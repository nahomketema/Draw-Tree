# Introductions
Welcome to the Draw Tree program! This is a program that attempts to display a binary search tree in the same way we write it down on paper(kind of). The benefit of this type of display is that it gives you a more realistic view of your tree and where the nodes are located within it.

# How to use
- Prior to using this program on your terminal, I highly recommend setting the font size of your terminal as small as possible. The reason is because as the tree height increases, the display starts overlapping which messes everything up.
- I also recommend trying to input as few data as possible in order for the program to work properly.
- Note that this is a test program and view it as such. 

# Instructions
1. First, download the code to your computer. Make sure you have a terminal to try it on. This program has only been tested on Windows Terminal and therefore might behave different on other shells.
2. Once that is done, you can either use the makefile or compile it yourself in order to run it.
3. Run it and enjoy!
